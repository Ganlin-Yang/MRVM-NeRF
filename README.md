## [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04962) | [Models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16vpZwuKuK3NkHwir3zM_lyMdxbFFZ70z?usp=sharing)

The repository for two baselines: NeRFormer and NeuRay is located in folder [NeRFormer+MRVM](./NeRFormer+MRVM/) and folder [NeuRay+MRVM](./NeuRay+MRVM/) respectively.

## Have Done 
- Open-source the codes and models for [NeuRay+MRVM](./NeuRay+MRVM/) 

## Todo List 
- Open-source the codes and models for [NeRFormer+MRVM](./NeRFormer+MRVM/)
